# Fun Calculator 🎉

A simple and fun calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers with a touch of humor! 😄

## Features ✨

- **Addition** ➕: Adds two numbers together.
- **Subtraction** ➖: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication** ✖️: Multiplies the two numbers.
- **Division** ➗: Divides the first number by the second (watch out for division by zero! 🚨).

## How to Use 🚀

1. Run the script in a Python environment (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Enter the second number when prompted.
4. Voilà! The calculator will display the results of all four operations.

### Example Usage:
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2

Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0
Difference: 8.0
Product: 20.0
Quotient: 5.0
```

## Important Notes ⚠️

- The calculator uses `float()` to handle decimal numbers.
- Division by zero will cause an error (the script assumes responsible input for now).

## Future Improvements 🔧

- Add error handling for division by zero.
- Extend functionality to support more operations (e.g., exponentiation, modulus).
- Add a loop to allow continuous calculations until the user exits.
